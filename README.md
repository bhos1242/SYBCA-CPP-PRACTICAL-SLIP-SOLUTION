Some Important Viva Questions

Sure, here are the answers to the C++ viva questions:

1. What is C++? Explain the basic features of C++.

Answer: C++ is an object-oriented programming language that is an extension of the C programming language. The basic features of C++ include data encapsulation, data abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic binding.

2. What are the differences between C and C++?

Answer: C++ is an extension of C and includes additional features such as object-oriented programming, templates, and exceptions. C++ also allows for function overloading, references, and namespaces.

3. What is an object-oriented programming paradigm? Explain the main concepts of object-oriented programming.

Answer: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects. Objects have data and behavior associated with them, and they can interact with one another. The main concepts of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

4. What is a constructor? Explain the different types of constructors.

Answer: A constructor is a special member function of a class that is called when an object of that class is created. The different types of constructors include default constructors, parameterized constructors, copy constructors, and destructors.

5. What is a destructor? Explain the use of a destructor.

Answer: A destructor is a special member function of a class that is called when an object of that class is destroyed. The destructor is used to free up any resources that were allocated during the lifetime of the object.

6. What are the access specifiers in C++? Explain the difference between them.

Answer: The access specifiers in C++ are public, private, and protected. Public members are accessible from anywhere in the program, private members are accessible only within the class, and protected members are accessible within the class and its derived classes.

7. What is the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference?

Answer: Pass-by-value involves passing a copy of a variable to a function, whereas pass-by-reference involves passing a reference to the original variable. Pass-by-reference can be more efficient since it avoids copying the entire variable.

8. What is a virtual function? Explain the use of virtual functions.

Answer: A virtual function is a function that is declared in a base class and can be overridden in a derived class. Virtual functions are used to achieve dynamic polymorphism, where the correct function to call is determined at runtime based on the type of the object.

9. What is polymorphism? Explain the different types of polymorphism.

Answer: Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. The different types of polymorphism include compile-time polymorphism, which is achieved through function overloading and templates, and runtime polymorphism, which is achieved through virtual functions and inheritance.

10. What is inheritance? Explain the different types of inheritance.

Answer: Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class. The different types of inheritance include single inheritance, multiple inheritance, and multilevel inheritance.

11. What is an abstract class? Explain the use of an abstract class.

Answer: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be used as a base class for other classes. Abstract classes often contain pure virtual functions, which are meant to be implemented in the derived classes.

12. What is the difference between private and protected members in a class?

Answer: Private members are accessible only within the class, whereas protected members are accessible within the class and its derived classes.

13. What is a template in C++? Explain the use of templates.

Answer: A template in C++ is a mechanism that allows a function or class to
